	between start of line and start of text on repeated Home presses.

	* src/e/ptextarea/PKeyHandler.java: Always move the caret on
	pageup/down.  Try to keep the cursor in the same position when
	paging as well.

	* PTextAreaRenderer.java: Don't draw the cursor as a squre yet, go
	back to using an 'I' for now.
