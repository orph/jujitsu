# When I built on wide, once, it upgraded my work areas to Subversion 1.4.
# Wide is amd64, which is only supported in etch, which only has svn 1.4.
# ithaki runs stable, which is currently sarge, which only has svn 1.1.

# This was my solution:

# /net/ithaki/usr/local/bin/svn now contains:
# #!/bin/bash
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/net/duezer/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH exec /net/duezer/usr/bin/svn "$@"

# /net/ithaki/usr/local/bin/svnversion now contains:
# #!/bin/bash
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/net/duezer/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH exec /net/duezer/usr/bin/svnversion "$@"

# Now all my svn updates on ithaki terminate with "Killed by signal 15" (SIGTERM) but seem to work.
