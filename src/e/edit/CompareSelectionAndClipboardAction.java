/**
 * Shows a patch to turn the clipboard into the selection. Useful for confirming
 * that you're looking at copy & paste code before you remove it.
 * 
 * Obvious extensions:
 * 
 * 1. We don't know much about the data on the clipboard, but we know a lot
 *    about the selection; we could use that to allow double-clicking to take
 *    you to the line in question.
 * 
 * 2. Suppose you're comparing code where someone's changed an identifier or
 *    a magic number, and there are bogus differences where all you need is a
 *    parameter. Would something like replaceAll("\\b(\\d+|0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\\b",
 *    "123") to replace numeric literals with one constant -- and similar for
 *    string literals and identifiers -- be helpful?
