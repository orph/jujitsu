/**
 * Helps avoid writing applications that don't exit. If you use Swing's Timer,
 * your application won't exit as long as you have running timers. (You can
 * diagnose such problems with the HungAwtExit class.) If you have a one-shot
 * timer, that's not such a problem because it just leads to a slightly
 * delayed exit. If you have a repeating timer, your application won't exit.
 * 
 * Somehow, you need to stop your timers when their windows are disposed. It
 * may be convenient in your application to do so, but it probably isn't, and
 * even when it's convenient, it will still take some amount of unnecessary
 * code. Just use an instance of this class instead. Each Timer is associated
 * with a Component, and the timer only runs while the component is
 * displayable.
